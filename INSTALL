DEPENDENCIES
 
 ForSyDe depends on GHC >= 7 due to the use of numerous extensions,
 namely Template Haskell (TH).

 It depends on the type-level and parameterized-data packages and some
 others normally bundled with GHC distributions.

 For synthesis and simulation of the generated VHDL the Altera toolchain is
 supported. Quartus and Modelsim need to be on the PATH for these features to
 work.  Additionally the open-source VHDL simulator Ghdl is supported from
 version ghdl-0.33 onwards.

INSTALLATION

See http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Cabal/How_to_install_a_Cabal_package

Here is a summary on how to install ForSyDe manually:

To install globally, for the whole system (requires admin permissions):

$ ./Setup.hs configure
$ ./Setup.hs build
$ ./Setup.hs haddock # generate documentation, optional, 
                     # requires Haddock > 2.0 due to the use of TH
$ sudo ./Setup.hs install

To install locally and just for your own user:

$ ./Setup.hs configure --user --prefix=The/selected/local/directory
$ ./Setup.hs build
$ ./Setup.hs haddock  # generate documentation, optional, 
                      # requires Haddock > 2.0 due to the use of TH
$ ./Setup.hs install
