DEPENDENCIES
 
 ForSyDe depends on GHC >= 7 due to the use of numerous extensions,
 namely Template Haskell (TH).

 It depends on the type-level and parameterized-data packages and some
 others normally bundled with GHC distributions.

INSTALLATION

See http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Cabal/How_to_install_a_Cabal_package

Here is a summary on how to install ForSyDe manually:

To install globally, for the whole system (requires admin permissions):

$ ./Setup.hs configure
$ ./Setup.hs build
$ ./Setup.hs haddock # generate documentation, optional, 
                     # requires Haddock > 2.0 due to the use of TH
$ sudo ./Setup.hs install

To install locally and just for your own user:

$ ./Setup.hs configure --user --prefix=The/selected/local/directory
